# Example Scala.js application 

This site houses Scala code, on a scala.js template, for a 
[binary arithmetic operations inserter](https://github.com/danlaudk/my-scalajs-public/blob/gh-pages/src/main/scala/example/ArithmeticUI.scala). It solves the simplest-stated problem for which I could not find an online  solution, and it also happened to be a variant of a puzzle (not a coding puzzle) posted at work for fun. The statement is taken from [99 Scala problems](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/)  (#93)

# An arithmetic puzzle
Given a list of integer numbers, find a correct way of inserting arithmetic signs (operators) such that the result is a correct equation. Example: With the list of numbers List(2,3,5,7,11) we can form the equations 2-3+5+7 = 11 or 2 = (3*5+7)/11 (and ten others!).

# Solution
A working solution, compiled down to javascript, is at the github.io view of the gh-pages branch (https://danlaudk.github.io/my-scalajs-public/)

The rest of the files in this repo are irrelevant and come from the scala-js workbench, from which this repo is forked.
